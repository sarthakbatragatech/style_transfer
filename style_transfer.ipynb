    "To keep it simple, **Neural Transfer** involves reproducing the contents of an *input image* with the artistic style of a *style image*. For example, can we take the *style* of the watercolor painting below and the *content* of the turtle image in order to produce a third image which is a 'combination' of the two. As you can see, this can lead to very fun results!\n",
